# pyMEEP

This is a Python package for running simulations MEEP (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep). It creates a .ctl file, runs it, and does some postprocessing and plotting. It is a very simplified adaption of pyMPB with some additional features.


Usage:
------
 
0. Install with pip (e.g., inside pymeep folder: pip install --user -e .)
0. See and adapt examples in examples folder


"Disclaimer"
---------------

I am in a hurry - I need to finish my thesis. So my code is neither
nice nor clean. 
Meanwhile, I hope somebody finds this useful!
